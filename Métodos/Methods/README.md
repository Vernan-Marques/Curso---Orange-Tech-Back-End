## Methods in Java

One class is defined by attributes and methods. We have already seen that attributes are, for the most part, variables of different types and values. Methods, in turn, correspond to functions or subroutines available within our classes.

### Method naming criteria

* Must be named as verb;
* Follow the camelCase pattern;

### Obs !!!
There is no concept of global methods in Java. All methods must be defined within a class.

## Method Definition Criteria

### 1) What is the main proposal os the method?

### 2) What type of return is expected after executing the method?
It will return a value or not.

### Obs !!!
If the method does not return any value, it will be represented by the keyword 'void'.
