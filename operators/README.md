* (++) Unary value increment operator - increments a value by one;
* (--) Unary value decrement operator - decrements a value by one;
* (!) Unary logical negation operator - negates the value of a boolean expression;

## Ternary Operator (?:)

It's a short way to defined a condition and to choose one of two values.

#### Sintaxe

(CONDITIONAl EXPRESSION) ? (IF TRUE CONDITIONAL) : (IF FALSE CONDITIONAL)

## Relational Operators

Relational operators evaluate the relationship between two variables or expressions.

* (==) When we want to check if a variable is equal to another;
* (!=) When we want to check if a variable is different from the other;
* (>) When we want to check if one variable is greater than the other;
* (<) When we want to check if one variable is less than the other;
* (<=)  When we want to check if one variable is less than or equal to another;
* (>=)  When we want to check if one variable is greater than or equal to another;
