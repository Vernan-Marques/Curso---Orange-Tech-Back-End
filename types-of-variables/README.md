# Types and Variables

## Data Types

In Java there's some In Java there's some reserved words to represent the basic data types that need to be handled 
for building programs. These types are known as primitive types.

There's eight types:
int, byte, short, float, double, boolean and char - These types are not considered objects, and therefore represent raw values. They are stored directly on the memory stack.

## Variable Declaration

Variable is an identification of a space in memory used by the program.
The standard structure to declaration a variable is:

(Type) + (variableName) + (valueAttributionOptional)

### Obs:

1) if a variable of type "int" or "long" starts with 0, the variable is probably of another type;

2) Types long and float must inform the letters L (long) and F (float) at the end of the variable value.

3) When a short number (short) is changed to an integer value (int) and later converted to short again, a "cast" must be performed for this change to actually occur.
